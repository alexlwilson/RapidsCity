			<h1>Village Government</h1>
 	   		<article>
				<p>
					The legislative system in Rapids City consists of a Village Board, comprised of the President and six Trustees.
					The Board is responsible for passing Village Ordinances, adopting an operating budget and other Village policies. 
					The President is responsible for carrying out policies and ordinances set by the Board, supervising the operation 
					of the Village and appointing committees.  The President and the Trustees are elected to four-year staggered terms. 
					Elections are held every two years for 3 of the 6 Trustee positions.
				</p>  
				<p>
					The operating budget and appropriation ordinance is passed prior to the fiscal year, which is May 1st through April 30th.  
					The main source of revenue to the Village is through the collection of taxes.  The Tax Levy Ordinance sets the taxes for 
					each year for such purposes as funding day-to-day operating expenses, police protection, maintinance of the cemetery, 
					audit expenses, liability insurance and retirement funding.
