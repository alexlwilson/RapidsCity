			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>
				Located at the upper end of the Rock Island Rapids, Rapids City grew around 
				the site of a grist and saw mill.  Laid out in 1838 and incorporated in 1875, 
				the village boomed during the 1870's through the 1880's.
				Because of neighboring coal mines during this period, grocery and dry goods stores, a 
				blacksmith shop, a restaurant, hotel, millinery and shoe store provided services for miners, 
				farmers, and their families.  Charles Shuler operated the Rapids City Coal Mining Company 
				during the 1880's.

				Mills were important to local businesses, especially in the early years.  Sawmills provided
 				lumber for building homes and businesses and grist mills turned locally grown grain into 
 				flour for houshold use.  Rapids City's first grist and saw mill was built by the Wells 
 				brothers from nearby Hampton.

				Modern day Rapids City is located in the eastern portion of the Quad City metropolitan 
				area along the banks of the Mississippi river in northwestern Illinois.  It is a part of 
				Rock Island County and is situated where Interstate 80 crosses into Iowa.  Rapids City's 
				land area equals 960 acres with a perimeter boundary just under 6 miles.  The current 
				population of 960 citizens is growing due to increased housing starts in new subdivisions.
