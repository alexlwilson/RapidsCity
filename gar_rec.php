					<strong>Garbage</strong>: The Village of Rapids City contracts

						and rules apply: The rate for garbage pickup is $10.75 per month, covering curbside 
						recycling every other week and monthly large item pick up and administrative costs.  
						The cost of this service is billed on your water/sewer bill or separately 
						for those without village water or sewer. Charges are for the past month's 
						service as are water and sewer. Garbage is picked up after 7:00 a.m. on Friday of each week.
						There is a large item pickup the first Friday of every month.  
 						In the event of a holiday, garbage will be picked up on Saturday.

 						<strong>Recycling</strong>: will be picked up every other week.
 						Recycling schedules can be picked up at the village office.
 						Recycling is strongly recommended but not mandatory at this time.  
 						We encourage all residents to participate in the recycling learning process. 
 						It is predicted recycling will be mandatory in Rock Island County 
 						at a later date. The cost of recycling is included in the garbage 
 						rate, whether you choose to recycle or not. A recycling bin 
 						is provided to each household by Allied Waste. Allied Waste
