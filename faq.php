				<p>The following is a set of the most commonly asked questions and the most specific answers we can provide to those questions.</p>

				<p>
					Q.  When should I put my garbage out?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A.  By law, your refuse must be ready for pickup by 7:00 a.m. on your collection day, Rapids City collection day is Friday.  You may put it out anytime after 6:00 p.m. the evening before.  Due to unforeseen scheduling demands we can not guarantee any particular time of the day that your truck will be around.  If you miss the truck, hold your trash until the next week.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Q.  What does it mean when they say "properly packaged refuse"? 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A.  In order to be "properly packaged", all trash must be in containers made of rigid (durable) metal or plastic with secured handles and tight fitting lids.  Containers must be no smaller than 10 gallon and no larger than 33 gallon capacity.  Plastic trash bags are also accepted.  They should be intact, securely tied and within the container size guidelines of 10-33 gallons.  Containers should be kept drained of all liquids and kept closed or covered at all times.

					Q.  Why do sanitation crews leave certain things at the curb?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A. Here are some common reasons:  You may have missed your "bulky item" pickup day.  Rapids City 's large item pickup is the first Friday of each month.  A crew member may have spotted yard waste mixed in with your regular trash. Your trash may be "improperly packaged" (see above).  Also, they cannot take building materials or auto parts.  It may be possible that you did not have your trash out by 7:00 a.m. and you missed the truck when it came by.  It may also be possible that hazardous waste materials were put out for collection.  If none of these applies, please call your municipal sanitation contractor, Allied Waste at 1-800-233-9634.
